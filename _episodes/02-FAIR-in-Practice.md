Participants will get an introduction to the FAIR principles and an overview of some of the major community projects and technological approaches for implementing FAIR and complying with mandates such as Plan S.

An interactive discussion on data management challenges will have participants work through sections of grant applications (their own and provided examples) to identify weak points in FAIRness.

# Practical Data Management

## Initial Lesson Development

**Episode Responsibilities**

|Episode|Lead|Authors|Description|Hands-on/Discussion only|Approximate time|
|-------|----|-------|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
|01 - Workshop Overview|Jason|Jason|Brief overview of CyVerse (publicly funded infrastructure project) and how it is being adopted internationality (CyVerse UK/Austria/Australia), how you can make free use of it, and how these and other technologies are relevant to European bioinformatics and infrastructure projects (e.g. ELIXIR and EOSC). We will also introduce common tools and related vocabulary for computing in life science research.|Discussion|00:30|
|02 - FAIR in Practice||Rob?|Participants will get an introduction to the FAIR principles and an overview of some of the major community projects and technological approaches for implementing FAIR and complying with mandates such as Plan S. Key ideas and approaches to Open Science will be introduced. An interactive discussion on data management challenges will have participants work through sections of grant applications (their own and provided examples) to identify weak points in FAIRness.|Discussion|01:00|
|02 - Metadata Standards||Mateusz? Rob?|Participants will learn how community and repository standards can be selected and implemented for their own datasets.|Hands-on/Discussion|00:30|
|03 - Open Refine||Mateusz|Using the free and open-source software Open Refine, participants will explore how metadata can be organized and validated to comply with their choice of metadata standards.|Hands-on|01:45|
|04 - CyVerse/COPO Metadata ||Jason/Ramona/Rob|Users will be guided through associating metadata with data on the CyVerse platform using its graphical interface to iRODS (a data storage technology used by several international repositories)|Hands-on|00:30|
|05 - Repositories||Fotis? Rob? Allegra?|We will introduce popular repositories and the typical requirements for publication of datasets including choices of licensing.|Discussion|00:30|
|06 - CyVerse Publication||Jason/Ramona|Participants will be guided through making data available and citable (DOI issuing) on the CyVerse data store. We will also demonstrate publication directly from CyVerse to NCBI and also ENA using COPO.|Hands-on/Discussion|00:30|
|07 - Preprints|Jason|Jason|We will discuss the evidence and some available solutions for making use of pre-prints and solutions for choosing a data license.|Discussion|00:30|
|08 - Data Stewardship wizard|||Participants will start to summarize lessons learned by completing a Data Stewardship wizard and generating an updated data management plan|Hands-on|00:30|
|09 - Data management planning and summary||Rob|Participants will work in small teams to develop learning roadmaps to be implemented post-workshop (How will the workshop change what they are now doing? What questions do they still have? What technologies would the like more information on? etc.). These will be shared and collected and the instructional team will leave additional feedback and suggestions on the maps during and shortly after the workshop.|Hands-on/Discussion|01:45|


**Episode Descriptions**

Here is a space with brief notes for each episode. The purpose is to share enough
detail here that subsequent/episodes can be aligned.

When you are ready post your learning objectives here. Also pay attention to
the dependencies  (i.e. things you need a previous episode to accomplish);
indicate all dependencies you need (they may not be from the immediately previous
episode). Also indicate any products you create that you think will be used downstream.
Also - if users will need to install software, import data, sign-up for
an account, please note that here so we have an easier time building the
workshop setup info.

### Workshop Overview

**Draft learning objectives**:

 - Understand the objectives for the workshop
 - Understand the background and purpose of the CyVerse project
 - List current European iniatives concerned with the promotion of open data in
   the life sciences

**Narrative**:

This short overview will set the tone for the workshop. Learners should
understand what our goals are, but realize that the materials are
work-in-progress (and that we can be flexible). Learners should also know
what are some European projects they might want to learn more about.

**Dependencies from previous episode**:

None

**Products/outputs for subsequent episodes**:

 - Product/output:
   - Learners should confirm at this stage they have completed pre-workshop
     setup items, and be invited to alert instructors to unresolved problems.

**User setup notes**:

 - Tool/dataset/account: CyVerse Account

### CyVerse/COPO Metadata

**Draft learning objectives**:

 - Be able to download a metadata template
 - Be able to complete a metadata template
 - Be able upload a metadata template and associate metadata with data in CyVerse
 - Be able to search for data within CyVerse using metadata descriptors
 - Be able to share datasets within CyVerse

**Narrative**:

We will do an exercise in which learners complete a sample metadata template
to annotate a sample dataset. They will then share these data with another
CyVerse user.
**Note**: If we are introducing COPO here we need to harmonize this use case.
I also think we may need a little more time to accomplish this - and that
could come from combining this episode with episode 07.

**Dependencies from previous episode**:

 - Episode: 03 Metadata Standards
 - Dependency: Awarness of metadata standards and basic metadata vocabulary
 - Episode: 04 Open Refine
 - Dependency: We can take a metadata CSV that has been cleaned in the Open
   Refine lesson and use it as the example metadata template for this lesson


**Products/outputs for subsequent episodes**:

 - Product/output:
   - A dataset annotated with metadata

**User setup notes**:

 - Tool/dataset/account: CyVerse Account

### CyVerse Publication

**Draft learning objectives**:

- Understand the process for making data publicly available through CyVerse
- Understand how CyVerse can be used to submit data to SRA
- Understand how COPO can be used to submit data to ENA

**Narrative**:

Working from a completed metadata template, we will guide users through the
steps for direct submission to sequence data repositories.

**Dependencies from previous episode**:

 - Episode: 05 CyVerse/COPO/Metadata
 - Dependency: Awarness of CyVerse metadata tools

**Products/outputs for subsequent episodes**:

 - Product/output:
   - Sample dataset annotated for SRA/ENA submission

**User setup notes**:

 - Tool/dataset/account: CyVerse Account


----

### Preprints

**Draft learning objectives**:

- Understand what preprints are
- Understand the history of prepints in life sciences
- Understand the benefits of preprints
- Discuss the benefits (possible risks) or preprints

**Narrative**:

This will be a short lecture and discussion on preprints
